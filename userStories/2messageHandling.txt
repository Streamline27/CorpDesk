Message Handling

Message send, read, delete, move to folder between users.

Each user may see own folders:
* Inbox
* Sent
* Draft
* Deleted
* Other User-created folders

Message may be composed and afterwards sent by everyone to one, many or all users.
After being sent it stored into folder ‘Inbox’ of the user or users to whom it was sent and marked unread.
User may open it, then it marked as read, move to another folder or delete permanently.
Message may be replied and forwarded – it will be opened in ‘Compose Message’ with modifications shown below.
If message is replied:
* Title: “Re: “ + OriginalTitle	“Fwd: “ + OriginalTitle
* Body: “Replied Message on ” + OriginalMessageTimestamp + “<br><br>” + OriginalBody
* Recipient: OriginalSender	empty
If message is forwarded:
* Title: “Fwd: “ + OriginalTitle
* Body: Forwarded Message on ” + OriginalMessageTimestamp + “<br><br>” + OriginalBody
* Recipient: empty
